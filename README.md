## 🎮 Introduction

This is an alternate version of our mixed reality game developed for the Meta Quest 3.  
In this version, we replace the *Infinity Stone* mechanic with an exciting **destructible wall system**.

Players can shoot and destroy physical-looking walls in their room to reveal a breathtaking **outer space virtual scene**, where aliens emerge. The interaction creates a powerful immersive experience by blending physical destruction with virtual surprises.

## 👾 Gameplay Overview

1. **Room Scanning:**  
   Players begin by scanning their room to establish spatial awareness and generate mesh data for destructible surfaces.

2. **Wall Destruction & Alien Encounter:**  
   Instead of an infinity stone portal, players now use a **virtual laser gun** to shoot through destructible walls. Once a section of the wall is destroyed, it reveals **outer space** and triggers an alien invasion.

3. **Combat Mechanics:**  
   Players aim and shoot aliens using the **Meta Quest 3’s right-hand controller**. Laser effects are precisely mapped, and players must defend against the alien threat while navigating a mixed environment of physical and virtual reality.
