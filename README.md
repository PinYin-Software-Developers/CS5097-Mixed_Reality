## 🎮 Introduction

This project is a mixed reality game developed for the Meta Quest 3, where players shoot virtual aliens in a real-world environment.  

Using the MetaQuest 3's built-in cameras, the game overlays digital elements on top of the player's physical surroundings — including furniture and objects in their room — to create an immersive alien shooter experience.

## 👾 Gameplay Overview

1. **Room Scanning:**  
   Players begin by scanning their room to establish spatial awareness and mapping.

2. **Alien Encounter Begins:**  
   Once the scan is complete, a virtual **stargate portal** appears. Aliens begin pouring into the room accompanied by dynamic music.

3. **Combat Mechanics:**  
   Players are equipped with a **virtual laser gun**, mapped precisely to the MetaQuest 3’s **right-hand controller**.  
   The player must aim and shoot at aliens as they appear, using the real room as a battleground.
